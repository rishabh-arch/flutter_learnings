At first IDK anything about Dart, so i am going to learn it through project and makes notes here.

## Installing first time
I got some problems while creating setup environment for flutter

### problems - 
1. - [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs),Doctor said I am not healthy so i need to follow his conditions
        by installing all stuffs as he said.
        - Android studio with Avd
        - Visual studio
           - c++ desktop developing
        - vs code

2. - [Understanding Constraints](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/ui/layout/constraints)

3. - [BuildContext](https://blog.mindorks.com/understanding-buildcontext-in-flutter),Know about Build Context
